# Steady-Ranging-Persistence
Small piece of code in python to compute steady and ranging persistence of features of a hypergraph filtration.

- Part of the code (mostly the file `persistence.py` is borrowed from the following (Generalized Persistence Analysis)[https://github.com/LimenResearch/gpa] tool.
- Hypergraphs are coded using (HyperNetX)[https://github.com/pnnl/HyperNetX].
- Progress bar uses (tqdm)[https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm].

Here is a great link for diverse hypergraph datasets: (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/)[https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/].
